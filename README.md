## ü§ñ Finger-Controlled LED System with ESP8266 & OpenCV
## üìå Project Description
This project is an implementation of hand-gesture-based LED light control utilizing Computer Vision and Internet of Things (IoT) technology.
Using a laptop/PC camera, the system can detect the number of raised fingers in real time and then send commands to the ESP8266 to control the on/off of two LEDs connected to a microcontroller board. This system combines image processing using OpenCV and MediaPipe with serial communication between Python and the ESP8266. MediaPipe is used to detect the position of points on the hand (landmarks), while OpenCV is responsible for displaying visualizations such as bounding boxes, the number of fingers, and LED status on the screen.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Materials
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU / Wemos D1 Mini)
- 2 LEDs
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Resistors (220Œ© for LEDs)
- Laptop/PC with camera

## üîå Circuit Diagram
1. Positive pole of LED 1 ‚Üí pin D1
2. Positive pole of LED 2 ‚Üí pin D2
3. Negative pole of both LEDs ‚Üí GND ESP8266
4. Use a 220Œ© series resistor to limit the LED current.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Upload the test.ino code to the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyserial
```
3. Run app.py in Python :
```bash
python app.py
```
4. Make sure the COM port in app.py matches the ESP8266 port.
5. Point your hand at the camera ‚Üí the LED will turn on/off according to the number of fingers.

## üìã Uses in Daily Life (Descriptive)

This system is designed to provide a touchless electronic device control solution, which has many real-life benefits :
1. Touchless Light Control
- Useful in environments that require high hygiene, such as hospital operating rooms, laboratories, or kitchens.
- Reduces the risk of transmitting bacteria or viruses because there's no need to touch switches.
2. Accessibility Technology
- Helps people with disabilities or the elderly who have difficulty operating physical switches.
- Device control becomes easier with just hand gestures.
3. Smart Home & Home Automation
- Can be integrated with smart home systems to control lights, fans, automatic blinds, or other electronic devices touchlessly.
4. Technology Exhibitions & Education
- Great for display at technology exhibitions or as teaching materials in schools/universities.
- Teaching basic concepts of Computer Vision and IoT through real-world applications.
5. Modern Work Environment
- Can be used in offices, recording studios, or creative workspaces to control spotlights, audio equipment, or other devices without leaving your work position.
